/**
 * A randomization [Animation] that shuffles between different visuals.

 * Shuffles through visuals in the given [visuals] [List] for given [duration] and shows [toVisual]

 * For example:

 * An animation with [duration] = 1s and [speed] = 50 will change the visual 50 times within the
 * [duration] of one second.
