## Prior knowledge

All GameComponentViews inherit from [ComponentView][ComponentViewDoc] and [DynamicView][DynamicView].
It is therefore helpful to read those documentations first as the features from those superclasses don't get repeated here.

## Introduction

[GameComponentViews][GameComponentDoc] are used to model interactive game elements like cards, meeples or any other
form of game tokens.
GameComponentViews can be added to [GameComponentContainers][ContainerDoc] and be made draggable as explained in
[this][DnDDoc] tutorial.
Helpful animations can be found [here][AnimationDoc]

## Generic Token

For a generic token use [TokenView][TokenDoc]. It takes its position and dimensions as well as one visual as
a constructor parameter.

## Cards

For cards use [CardView][CardDoc]. It by default takes a front and back visual and offers additional functions to handle
the card.
As cards are a common concept, there exists a [CardStack][CardStackDoc] especially for CardViews.
For card hands, a [LinearLayout][LinearLayoutDoc] may become handy.

The CardView can also be used for other two-sided tokens.

## Dice

The [DiceView][DiceDoc] class takes a list of visuals for its sides.
It is not limited to a D6 and has the exact amount of sides as it has visuals, where the visual at index i is the i-1th
side e.g. the visual at index 0 is side 1.
If the list of visuals gets altered the amount of sides changes too.

For a dice roll there exists a dedicated [DiceAnimation][DiceAnimationDoc].

## Hexagons

The [HexagonView][HexagonDoc] component can also be utilized for hexagonal tokens,
providing a versatile solution for displaying various hexagonal-shaped elements.

Hexagons only have one visual.
