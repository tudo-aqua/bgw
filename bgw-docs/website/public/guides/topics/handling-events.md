# Handling Events

To make the game playable, we need to make our components interactive. This is achieved by incorporating event handlers into the components.

## Assigning Event Handlers
Upon launching the application, both the menu scene and the game scene are displayed, with the game scene appearing blurred in the background.

To initiate a new game and dismiss the menu scene, we need to assign event handlers. Since the actions of these buttons alter the scene, we set the handlers within the application.

````kotlin
object MauMauApplication : BoardGameApplication(
    windowTitle = "MauMau"
) {
    val mauMauMenuScene = MauMauMenuScene()
    val mauMauGameScene = MauMauGameScene()

    init {
        registerMenuEvents()

        showGameScene(mauMauGameScene)
        showMenuScene(mauMauMenuScene)
        show()
    }

    private fun registerMenuEvents() {
        mauMauMenuScene.continueGameButton.apply {
            onMouseClicked = {
                hideMenuScene()
            }
        }

        mauMauMenuScene.newGameButton.apply {
            onMouseClicked = {
                // Start new game logic here
                hideMenuScene()
            }
        }

        mauMauMenuScene.exitButton.apply {
            onMouseClicked = {
                exit()
            }
        }
    }
}
````

## Conclusion 

Upon clicking the *"New Game"* button, the menu scene is concealed, and the game scene becomes active. To render the game functional, it's necessary to assign handlers to the cards and implement the game logic.
